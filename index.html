                            <p>Cookie Clicker Unblocked is a game about making an absurd amount of cookies. To help you in this endeavor, you will recruit a wide variety of helpful cookie makers, like friendly Grandmas, Farms, Factories, and otherworldly Portals.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hundreds of upgrades and achievements to unlock.</li>
    <li>The game continues while your phone is closed, so you can set up your ideal bakery and resume later to reap the delicious profits!</li>
    <li>Lovingly-crafted pixel art and flavor text!</li>
    <li>Ascend to gain permanent transcendental upgrades!</li>
    <li>Beware the grandmas!</li>
</ul>
<p>
    At first, the player clicks on the large cookie on the far left side of the screen, earning one cookie per click. With these cookies, the player can buy new assets such as cursors, grandmas, farms, mines, factories and banks that automatically make cookies. Prices increase exponentially, each asset costing 15% more than the last-purchased asset of the same type. Golden cookies, small cookies that appear in random locations and fade away after several seconds, appear periodically and grant effects, such as bonus cookies, or a temporary increase in the rate of production if clicked before they disappear.
</p>
<p>After earning a certain number of cookies, the player can 'ascend', losing their progress but earning heavenly chips and prestige levels. Prestige levels add a permanent boost (+1% per level) to the rate of cookie production in future play-throughs, while heavenly chips can be spent on a wide variety of prestige upgrades. However, the cookies needed to unlock the next prestige level goes up exponentially with the cube of the level, becoming harder to attain as more are acquired. Other game mechanics include "wrinklers" (eldritch beasts which reduce cookie production, but can be popped by clicking on them, returning all the cookies it digested with interest), the Cookie Dragon, mini games, and sugar lumps (which take 24 hours to coalesce and are used to level up buildings and boost their production rate). Achievements can be earned by completing various tasks or goals, such as reaching a certain number of total cookies produced, owning a particular number of buildings of a certain type or clicking a certain number of golden cookies. Additionally, seasonal events occur during their respective holidays which come with more upgrades and cookies to unlock.</p>
